    <h1>Chapter 4: Functions</h1>
    <pre>Function declarations

Normal function declaration using the function keyword

functions name(){}

function expression, declare a function by assigning it to a variable.
ie. const name = function(){};

this does end with a semicolon
This does mean function can be made anonymous without a conventional name,
this does make debugging harder though.

Function constructor
ie. const name = new Function('code');
problem with this method is that the contents of the function are put in
as a string. Other issue is that this method always creates the function
on the global scope.

Is there ever a time a function constructor would be more advantages than
the other methods of function declaration? Or is it just there for backwards
compatability?

from the text:

  Don’t Repeat Yourself,or DRY, is a principle of programming
  that specifies that every part of a program should only be
  written once. This avoids duplication and means there’s no need to
  keep multiple pieces of code up to date and in sync.

trying to invoke a function by name without the parentheses only references
the function. Can be useful to assign another pointer to a function

All functions have an argument array that holds all arguments passed into a
function, it can be accessed like an array but is not able to use some
array methods.

better method is to use the rest operator, which is placed in the last parameter
place infront of three dots. This will collect all the arguments an put them
into an array.

As seen in the mean() example the rest operator can be used to accept
any amount of arguments and store them into an array that can then be
accessed by the function.

Default parameters as of ES6 you can set defaults for parameters if
an argument is not provided for that parameter.
ie. function name(parameter = defaultValue)

prior to this the way to make defualt parameters was to check in the function
using ||
ie. name = name || "default";
if name was empty then it would assign the default parameter.
only works if empty is recognized by the language as false.

Default parameters should come after non-default parameters.

Arrow syntax => parameters befor the arrow and contents after the arrow
ie. const name = parameter => content;
advantages: More succinct, single parameters don't need parentheses.
if its one line then it doesn't need to be in a block, return is not required
They don't bind their own value  of "this" to the function.

If the function has no parameters then an empty parentheses is needed.
When contents require more than one line than a block is need and the value
of the arrow method is lost

Arrow method is useful for declaring small anonymous functions

callbacks : function passed as argument to another function

read through callbacks again for review.
