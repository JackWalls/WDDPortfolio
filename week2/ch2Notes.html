        <pre>variables: value stored in memory

primitive data types -> String, Symbol, Number, Boolean, Undefined, Null
object (includes arrays, functions, and object literals)

typeof operator used to detect data type (all non-primitive types return
as type of object)

declaring variables, const for a variable that would be reassigned
and let for variables that might be reassigned.

const objects can have their underlying data changed.
it only prevents reassignment of the object.

var isn't used to declare variables anymore due it not having block scope
block scope meaning their value only exists in the block
they were declared in
*note change prior js to use let and const where appropriate.

scope: where a constant or variable is accessible by the program

global scope: declared outside a block. global access (accessible anywhere
in the program)
Usually kept to a minimum to avoid name conflicts that can
cause overwrites.

local scope: only accessible in the block it was declared in.

from the text:

  Variables that start with an underscore generally refer to
  private properties and methods, so it's best to not
  follow this convention for your own variable names.

  The $ character is also used by the popular jQuery library,
  so using this in your variable names may also cause problems.

important to remember that object variables are pointers
making copies of the pointers will not make seperate objects, they
will both refer to the same object stored in memory.
So any changes to a "copy" will cause changes to the original.
ie. x = {object: 1}, y = x, y.object = 3, now x.object = 3

All properties of primitive data types are immutable,
meaning they’re unable to be changed.

converting/parsing

String to number: use Number('string') if the string can't be converted it will
return as NaN

Number to string: use String(number) method.
Or #..toString(optional to make in binary)

parseInt('string', number base) convert a string representation of a
number into Number type.
also can set the base of number.
This function does ignore decimals (does not round numbers).

parseFloat() works for decimals.

template literals: special type of string that use the ` character.
Can have javascript expressions inside the string inside a ${script}.

from the text:

  Template literals can be thought of as super-powered strings as
  they behave in the same way as normal string literals, but with
  the extra power of string interpolation. For this reason, it is not
  uncommon to see backticks used to createallstrings in ES6 code.

Symbols: They can be used to create unique values,
which helps to avoid any naming collisions.

created with the Symbol(), a description can be added in the parenthesis.

Number.isFinite() used to check if it is a number

Number.isNaN() used to check for NaN
