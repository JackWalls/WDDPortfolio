        <pre>delete array[i]; used to change the value at i to undefined

destructuring  is taking values out of the array and mking them into
individual variables, can also be used to swap variables in a more
efficient manner

array.length, returns length of array. length - 1 gives the last index of
the array.

this property is mutable, extra slots are filled with undefined, or
removed.

array.pop() used to return and remove the last item from an array.
Does not replace it with undefined.

array.shift() same as pop but works with the first item.

array.push(item) puts a new value at the end of the array
while returning the new length of the array.

array.unshift(item) same as push but puts it as the new first item.

array.concat(arr) is used to merge arrays in to a new array.
use the = operator to assign the new array.

  An alternative is to use the new spread operator that was added to ES6.
  The spread operator is three dots, ... that are placed in front of an array,
  with the effect of spreading out the elements of that array.

.join() can be used to turn all the items of the array into a string seperated
by commas.
parameter used to change seperators.

.slice(x,y) used to create a subarray from x index to y.
Does not change the original array

.splice(x,y,item(s)) places item(s) in place of x, y items will be removed at
and after x, every value after y is placed in the array. Also returns the
array that was removed. Can also be used to add items by making y = 0.
An empty will be returned. splice(x,y) can be used to simply remove values,
and get a sub array.

.reverse() to reverse order

.sort() used to alphabetically sort string values

.indexOf(item) used to find the index that the item is in, returns -1 if
item is not in the array.

.includes(item) like indexOf() but returns a true when found and false otherwise
an extra number parameter can be used to search through after the number index.

spread operator can be used to flatten a multidimensional array into one array.

sets are a data structure that cannot have duplicates.

let name = new Set() must use a constructor.
array can be used to place values inside Set at time of construction
ie. new Set([x,y,z]);
If a string is used as an argument than each letter will get its own place.
Like always any repeats will be ignored.

.add() adds value to set
use add to place words.
All arrays and objects are unique they can have the same values
but will not be considered duplicates.
No type coercion so string '2' and 2 are not duplicates.

.size() to get length of set.

.has(item) same as include but does not have index notation
(so it can't skip ahead)

.delete(item) used to remove the item from the set, returns true if succesful
false if failed (usually do to the item not being there)

.clear() remove all items from set

set can be converted into array using the spread operator.
Normal sets are susceptible to memory leaks when deleting arrays or objects

Use WeakSet() for these instances to avoid memory leaks. only arrays and objects
can be added to weak sets

Maps key value sets

.set(k,v) add a key and value

.get(k) find the key and return the value

.has(key) same as set has

.size() same as set

.delete(k) same as set

.clear() same as set

  Maps can be converted into a nested array of key-value pairs in a similar way
  to sets; using either the spread operator or the Array.from() method

WeakMaps for the same reason as weak sets

Ternary Operator ?

condition ? (code to run if true):(code to run if false);

alternative to if else

advantage: can make code more succinct
disadvantage: can be harder to read
