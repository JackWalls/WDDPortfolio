fetch api is the example to learn from

blob() reads a file and returns a promise that resolves with
a blob object

What is the point of blob besides checking type?

can create a response object.

When would it be preferable to do this, does this work
with all other API's or services.

You can use a request object for the argument of a fetch()
in which you can specify its properties. Can create it with
a constructor or initialize an anonymous object within the
function call. I suppose this is to specify other properties
or make easier containment/alteration of properties.

HTTP headers contain additional information about a request or
response. Look back to document for methods.

Do headers need to be set before making a request w/ fetch?
Or is it just more a more advanced approach to get specific
results?
