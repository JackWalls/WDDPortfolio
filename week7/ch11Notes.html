        <pre>Functions contain a length property that returns the number of
parameters a function has.

functions can be treated as methods to gain access to 'this'
by using the function.call(object) method, any parameters needed
are put after the first parameter.
The first parameter can be set to null to make a call to
the function.

.apply(object, [args]) works the same way but all other
arguments are stored in an array, which can be used to
have an array as a parameter.

You can add properties to functions as if it was an object

Memoization is used to handle repeated arguments used on a
function that is expensive to run, by using the arg as an index
for an array property cache, we can make it so that if an
argument is provided we can store it in the cache property
and go to it instead of running the function again.

Is it reasonable to use this for expensive computational functions
that require multiple arguments? Probably depends on the
repetitive use of the combination of arguments.

IIFE immediately invoked function are anonymous functions
invoked immediately after they are declared
could be useful for making global variables or quick functions
to keep variables inside its scope.
Can be used to create temporary functions that disappear after
use.

Placing all your code in a IIFE can be used to make 'use strict'
block so that it does not effect the entire js file.
useful for working with others that don't use it.

Functions can redefine themselves within themselves.
Note any properties created will be lost when redefined.

Can be used to check for older browsers not having certain
functions in order to make subsequent use more effective.

error first callbacks - look more into this.

Promise - future result of an asynchronous operation
**Practice making and using promises

What is considered more effective? Async or promises? Are there
circumstances where one is better than the other?

Functions can be used to return functions

Is this similar to a factory?

I used a closure for my To-Do application in order to make
a function have access to an array within the scope of the
outer function.

by returning the inner function you create a function call
that has access to the full scope of the outer function and
nested function.

Generator functions are iterable functions that keeps the
value of yield(return) and uses it for the next invocation
of next(). It is assigned to a variable that will maintain
the sequent values of yield for that variable for the life
of the program

Pure function
Return value is dependent only on the values provided by the
arguments.

No side effects, no changes to value or data outside of the
scope of the function

f(x) = y always

therefore pure functions must have

at least one argument and a return value.
