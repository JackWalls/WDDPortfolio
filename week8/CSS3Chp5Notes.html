        <h2>HTML5 and CSS3 Chapter 5: Transforms and Transitions</h2>
    </div>
    <div id="content">
        <pre>Work with the transform property, works with functions

translate(x, y) moves element from x left and y top

for older versions:
-webkit-transform: translate(45px,-45px); /* iOS8, Android
â†µ4.4.3, BB10 */
-ms-transform: translate(45px,-45px); /* IE9 only */

use of translateX() and translateY() are used to focus on
their respective position.

scale(x, y) scales the element based on the argument, if only
one argument is provided and is used as a scaling ratio so 1
does not change anything and 2 doubles the proportion

Multiple transform functions should be placed in the same transform
declaration, multiple transforms overwrite each other.

Scaling does not cause reflow like the height and width property

rotate works by angle value provided as the argument such as
degrees, grads, radians, or turns.

skew(x, y) skews the element by degrees provided, first arg
skews on the x axis and the other is y axis, if second parameter
is omitted only the x axis is skewed.

The origin of the transform is defaulted to the center of the
element.

you can change it by altering the value for the transform-origin
property by percentages or position (top, center, bottom, .etc)

Order of the transform functions do matter.

transition is used to for animations

from the text:
 The important point to note is that the transition is declared
 in the default or originating state. The -webkit- vendor
 prefix is still needed for older mobile devices, including
 iOS6.1, BlackBerry10, Android 4.3 and UC Browser for
 Android. All other browsers, including IE10 and Android 4.4
 browser support the un-prefixed syntax.

transition-property is used to define the properties to be
transitioned. For multiple properties, use commas to seperate.

transition-duration set the duration of the transition in ms or
s. 200ms is considered optimum.

transition-timing-function is used to have more control over
the pace of the transition.

transition-delay property is used to incur a delay before the
transition in either ms or s. useful for hover with a 50ms delay

Animation is based on the use of keyframes. The main key frames
is from and to, which is the start and end of the animation, or
through the use of percentages to determine a beginning or end.

To declare an animation you use the property animation-name
and assign the animation to it.

animation-duration is similar to transition duration.

animation-timing-function similar to transition counterpart.

animation-iteration-count lets you set how many times the animation
will loop through. default is 1 and max is infinite.

animation-direction can be use to change the way the animation
plays.

animation-delay is similar to it's counterpart

animation-fill-mode defines what happens before and after the
animation life cycle
