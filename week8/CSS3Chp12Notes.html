        <pre>Canvas API used to draw images with JS

Starts with having a canvas element, text in between shows
only when canvas is not supported

must set height and width within html, not css
Also canvas has no default styling.

In js you need to get the canvas element and a 2d context from
it.

We use the context ot alter the properties and then use methods
to draw the objects.

Canvas has a coordinate system but it works differently in that
0,0 is on the top right, and if size is x 200 y 200 then
200, 200 is on the bottom right corner.

createPattern is a method that is used to use an image for a pattern
that can be use for the fillStyle property.

In order to create different shapes you need a function to handle the
pathing that will draw the new shape.

To save the image created we use the toDataURL method to
get a url with a png or jpg of the drawing.

You can redraw images onto canvas using the drawImage method
which takes the image element and x and y coordinates (for
placement) as its arguments.

The advantage of canvas is that you get can get access to
the data property of the image.
