        <pre>Class declaration syntax, which is similar to other languages, is
the preferred method to create classes.

.constructor property will return the constructor function that
created that object.

static can be used to call static methods that are called by the class,
not by the instances.
ie const instance = new Class(); Class.static() works, instance.static()
does not.

All classes have a prototype property that contains all the class'
properties and methods that can be accessed or added to.

.prototype can be used to get the prototype property
or Object.getPrototypeOf('object')

prototype is live and shared by all instances

Never use arrays or objects as a default value in prototype

to make a variable private you have to declare it as a variable inside the
class declaration so it remains within the scope of the class.
In order to modify or access it you need setters and getters.

The root of all class inheritence leads to an instance of an object
literal as the root of the prototype. That object literal has its own
methods and properties but they cant be looped through due to being
enumberable.

An example of monkey-patching is adding methods that are supported in
older browsers.

Is this also looked down upon in the Javascript community? Why is monkey-
patching looked down at in general.

variables in a property descriptor value, writable, enumerable, configurable
are set default by the assignment operator.

use Object.defineProperty(object, 'property', property descriptor)
to set the values of the descriptor when you add it.

The product descriptor can have getters and setters as get() and set().
These take the place of the value attribute, you cant have these two
at the same time. This allows for control over how the assignment operator
behaves on a property.

This is powerful but should be used with care since it can cause confusion

Object.create(prototype) can be used to create new object with the
argument to act as the prototype for the new object.

Mixins, adding properties and methods of another object without using
inheritance.

Object.assign(object1, object2)  will add the properties of object2
to object, note that arrays or nested objects mixed in this way results
in shallow copies of those arrays/objects. As in they point to the same
object, a new one isn't created on the object1. A built function to
handle this can be use to make deep copies when arrays or objects are
found there.

From text
  Itâ€™s worth keeping in mind that if a method lacks a meaningful
  return value, it might as well return this so that chaining is
  possible.
