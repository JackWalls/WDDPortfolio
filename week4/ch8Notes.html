        <pre>It is more common to process information with js before sending it
to server end php/ruby language

document.forms returns a collection of all forms that can be accessed
by index notation.

you can also use the name attribute of the form to get that form

document.forms.name

can conflict with properties and methods of document.forms so to avoid
this you can enter the name in an index.
ie. document.forms['name'].

document.forms['name'].elements returns a collection of
elements within that form.

As before with the name attribute, it can be used to select a specific
element.

.submit() can be used to submit the form automatically, does not
trigger the form submit event.

.reset() will return them to default values, same can be done
with button with type set to reset.

from the text:
  Reset buttons are generally considered poor for usability,
  as they are too easy to click and then wipe out all the data
  thatâ€™s been entered. So think very carefully before using one
  in a form.

action property can alter the value in the form action attribute.

change event differs from blur in that a change must occur in the
input field and then lose focus to trigger. blur will trigger if both
are used but blur triggers after change.

you can add an event listener for submit that will occur before
the action is made, think of a confirmation dialog box.
preventDefault() can be used to prevent the action.

.elements['name'].value will give the value in that given element.
can be used to edit the value in their.

When a value is put in it remains when the user goes to change it.

Checkbox objects have a checked property that returns a boolean.

The value of a radio object is the selected option

The disable attribute can be a good tool to prevent submit from being
usable until certain requirements are met. these requirements and
case handling are done in js.
