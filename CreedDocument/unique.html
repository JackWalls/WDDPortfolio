        Some of the gifts that have been made known to me is that I am a quick learner, have good memory recall, and
    from the textbook have high dominance/directive . Since I was born it was noted that I could learn quickly from observing
    the actions of others. At a young age I had good computer literacy from simply observing my father work with our home
    computer. It was even said that I learned my fathers password just from observation. This has helped me with school
    since it makes it easier to learn the content quickly. Also in video games it helped me to understand the rules of
    the game to be able to enjoy them.

	    Memory recall was something also innate for me. I was generally a good test taker at school. However, being a quick
    learner made it so I would put less effort in developing a mastery of the material. So while I was able to do well on
    exams, I didn’t have a strong conceptual understanding of most of topics. The moment I better realized this ability was
    on my mission when I devoted myself to treasure the words of the lord so that when I spoke I could speak his word. It was
    during a lesson with a man with a Christian background that we had been teaching for a few weeks. He pointed out to me that
    he liked the way I taught since whenever a topic or question was brought up I would know and bring up an appropriate scripture.
    It was then I realized that promise, but also realized how I can apply it to everything else do and pursue.

	    The high dominance was more of a realization. It makes sense since it explains my favorite hobby and why I enjoy it so
    much. I like to play video games since it can always bring a sense of accomplishment. I enjoy setting goals and see myself
    improving at the game over time. This of course has given me some good hand eye coordination. It also explains one of my
    faults at being angry at the loss of control. That with being slow to anger, but rather more expressive when I do get angry don’t go well.

	    A few of my weaknesses comes from being shy, lazy, and absent-minded. I’m not a very social person. I fit the textbook
    definition of an introvert and do notice when I feel socially fatigued when in social events for long periods of time. At
    this point I feel that I just need practice but also awareness of my limits to improve in confidence in conversing with others.
    Laziness is definitely a weakness I’ve had throughout high school. I’ve had troubles with procrastinating before and missed a
    lot of opportunities because of it. It is recent that I started developing the attribute of diligence and determination that have
    helped to do well at BYU-I, just this last semester I got all A’s because I started putting school work to have higher priority.
    The problem I have with absent-mindedness is that it is easy to lose myself in my thoughts since I think and daydream for the most
    part. Especially now with the pandemic going on. I’ve tried to tackle this with being more observant and more focused on my work
    and projects now that I have all this time. Even now my struggle with my weaknesses have made me better now and ironically
    more mentally prepared for the isolation that came with the lockdowns from the pandemic.
