<b>Individuals who taught made an impact on my life.</b>

    •	Mission President Patrick
        He was my mission president while serving in Quebec. The main thing he taught me which strengthen my testimony and
        improved my mission, was how God lets us go on our own to put into practice his teachings so that we may grow more
        “independent” so to say. So he may not always prompt us to do something good, but expects us to do good when we see opportunities.

    •	Elder Weber
        This mission companion was my favorite, and taught me an important lesson about empathy and listening. I will never
        forget the lesson he taught me about listening in that one should avoid trying to bring up solutions and try to figure
        things out for someone else and just listen. Doing that can do more to help someone than trying to fix their problems.

    •	Brandon
        Was a really good friend I had at church, kind of messed with me at the beginning but we eventually became good friends.
        He taught me by example on how to be calm and collected. He was the most chill guy I know.

    •	Adopted metal dude
        Was a friend I had at Church, he was nice to me when everyone else ostracized me. He was kind of a misunderstood
        delinquent, a family adopted to give him a chance since he was already pretty old. He taught me about metal music
        which helped get through high school. It was sad to see him the day his folks were returning him to the orphanage.

    •	Mother
        The main thing my mother taught me was the importance of hard work and having a thick skin.

<b>Switch Points</b>

    •	Mission
        This was a switch point for me because I got an opportunity to learn about the culture and life experiences of others
        that helped expand my horizons. It was also a time of great spiritual and emotional growth for me.

    •	College
    Every semester I learn something new that is important to my own growth as an individual and as a disciple of Christ.
    The important lessons I learn that help me grow into a more wise individual help guide me to make better decisions and set
    better goals to improve myself.

<b>Forgiveness Plan</b>

        The first part is recognizing when I have developed negative feelings or understanding when a conversation or situation
    may escalate that may create negative feelings. For me this would be to recognize when I need to take a step back and look at
    what I am feeling or experiencing and see that for what they are. The best way to do that is reflect on the days events every
    night before going to bed to check since that is the only way to make sure I identify problems even if I fail to take a step back in the moment.

    I personally find that the best way to initially overcome negative feelings towards another is to try and empathize with them. I
    find that it is way more easier to forgive by starting with empathy to then turn it into sympathy. Around that would be the
    best time to forgive those you resent and to ask for forgiveness for harboring such feelings. To ask for more love and charity towards them.

    Of course taking the time to let them know you forgive others when they have wronged you is important, while also apologizing for my own misbehavior if applicable.
