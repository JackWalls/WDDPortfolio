    •	Mother

Advice from Mother:
Focus on your studies, many people go to college with a focus on partying and socializing. However, you must go in with the goal
of getting your degree to develop your career. The time for partying can wait after college when you have everything is settled.

    •	Sam
        o	Lifelong friend whom I trust to have my best interest in mind. Very creative and charming.
    •	Thavisay
        o	A friend whose judgement I trust to be fair and considerate. Knows a lot about history and strategy.
    •	Little Brother
        o	Way more social than me and overall has better social awareness than I do. Also cares a lot about his image so if I ever need input that, I go to him.
    •	Father
        o	Hard worker who has a strong faith in Christ. I find that he is the best one to turn to when it comes to spiritual insight.
    •	Brandon
        o	One of the most calm and collected people that I know of. Also rather creative and has good insights about the scriptures.
    •	Bro. Berganza
        o	One of the nicest person I know, also has a strong testimony and I feel that I can learn a lot from him.
