        <h2>Beliefs That I Hold</h2>
    </div>
    <div id="content">
        <pre>1.	Live and let live
    1.1.	 We shouldn’t judge or prohibit the life choices others make. Everyone should have the freedom to do as
            they wish. This of course is limited by the federal law, as long as it is just. Overall as long as someone’s
            choices doesn’t take away the same freedom and does not purposefully harm others they should be free to do whatever they wish.

2.	Be conscious an careful
    2.1.	Always be aware of your actions and their effect. Never assume that would you do and the consequences of that action will only affect yourself.

3.	Do not place your trust in man
    3.1.	In general do not place my trust in mankind. While there are those that are kind and compassionate, there are
            also those who would use you and cause harm. So be careful who you trust and how much trust you give. God is
            the only one you can put your full trust in and know that you will not be betrayed.

4.	Focus on your goals
    4.1.	Ignore the achievements of others. Do not compare what you can achieve with others. Focus on what you can
            do and how you will meet those goals.

5.	Failure is to be avoided
    5.1.	While this is a given, this is mostly a change that I had fairly recent with this belief. Before it was failure
            is unacceptable, but now I am more ok with failure but still want to avoid as much as possible.

6.	If you don’t take the initiative, than nobody will.
    6.1.	This is more of an observation that I gained from experience, if you expect someone else to lead a group for
            a project or anything else, more often than not everybody is going to sit idly by expecting the same out of others.
            So it is better to take charge than to wait for someone else to muster the courage to do so.

7.	Procrastination is, more often than not, not worth it
    7.1.	Also personal experience, it is better to get a head start on projects, exams, and any other difficult or time
            consuming task. The stress to cram and push yourself to try and get it done quickly is not worth the effort.

8.	It’s important to laugh
    8.1.	Life has a lot of reasons to be depressing or disappointing, might as well make the most of it and laugh and
            or enjoy the many opportunities you get. I find this just helps me have a more positive outlook during these
            trying times when there is so much in out there that is just awful.

9.	Be slow to anger
    9.1.	It is important to be patient and understanding with others as much as you can. So I try to remain calm as much
            as possible. I will admit that this does tend to make it to when I reach my limit to be angrier if had just let
            out regularly. I’m getting better at it though.

10.	Avoid judging others
    10.1.	This is oddly difficult for me since my humor is on the darker side so I look
            for ways to make small petty jabs for humor, and I expect the same. So it is easier for me to notice and
            callout faults of others, but I avoid doing so because all it does is inflate my ego and place an unfair label on others.
