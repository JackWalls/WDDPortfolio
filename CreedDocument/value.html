    •	Open Minded – It is important to understand the positions of others in order to come to compromises and understanding.

    •	Freely expressing oneself - I am honest in how I express with others. I don’t like to hold punches or withhold my
        thoughts for the sake of others.

    •	Avoid being Impulsive – I’m careful in all that I do. I avoid being impulsive in my decisions for I believe those kind of
        decisions lead to greater consequences.

    •	Logic – I believe that logical thinking has more value in general decision making than emotion.

    •	Broadening my horizons – I enjoy expanding my knowledge and learning from the experience of others. A lot of what
        influences my decisions comes from the wisdom of others and history.

    •	Loyalty – I am loyal to my friends and family. Regardless of whatever issues or disagreements may come I will always
        think highly of them and offer help whenever it is needed.

    •	Liberty – I believe in protecting the liberty that I and everyone else enjoy and fight for. As long as our actions
        don’t harm or impede the liberty of others, we should be free to do as we wish.

    •	Humor – I love humor, comedy, anything that brings laughter. In all my hardest moments I found respite from having a
        good sense humor and laughing off the stress.

    •	Gratitude – I am grateful for all that I have. I’ve been given so many blessings throughout my life, so appreciating those gifts is warranted.

    •	Learning – I constantly seek learning, knowledge is the treasure that we keep with us for eternity.

    •	Success – I value meeting my goals. The greatest satisfaction I find in life is in setting goals and meeting them.
