    <pre>
        .addEventListener('event', callback); is used as an event listener for
a node object.

Without a node object it will instead be applied to the whole page.

Html has inline attributes that can act as event listeners
they are however not used often due to
the idea that javascript and html should be kept seperate,
only one event listener of for each event-type
can be attached to an element.
You would have to look for the code in the html to know
when and where a function is called.

This event listener is not supported in older version of IE 8

When the eventListener is activated it will return an event object as
a parameter to the callback function. This can be used in a variety of
ways.

event properties:

.type returns the type of event that activated the listener.

.target returns pointer to the node that fired the event.

.page/client/screenX|Y all return coordinates of where a mouse event occurs

Reference to event types

.key property will return the name of the key that fired a key related
event

.removeEventListener('event', callback) method removes event listeners
Useful to make events happen only once

.preventDefault can be used to stop a an event from happening(for a hyperlink
as an example)

Bubbling occurs when you activate a child node, for clicking this can be
that after clicking on a p element you are also clicking
on its parent nodes. Bubbling goes up the tree to the root,
while capturing goes down the tree to the leaf. bubbling is default
while capturing has to activated.

.stopPropagation() can be used to prevent bubbling and capturing.
