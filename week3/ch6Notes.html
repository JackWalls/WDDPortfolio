    <h1>Chapter 6: The Document Object Model</h1>
    <pre>
DOM treats everything on the web page as a node,
so think of binary trees.

You can assign elements to variables

.nodeType returns number code
.nodeName, returns name of node in uppercase letters.

node list are like arrays but aren't, they do use index notation but
they don't have access to array methods. They do have the length property

they can be turned into a an array using Array.from('nodelist)
or the spread operator

.querySelector() and .querySelectorAll() are great methods that searches
for a css selector. These are a more precise way to look for objects
in the document.

.childNodes returns a node list of the all the children of a given element

.children only returns element nodes that are the children of a given node

.firstChild, and .lastChild return the first and last child
this can at times be a reference to a #text node that is empty

.parentNode returns the parent node of an element

.nextSibling and .previousSibling do as they written, think binary trees

Note if they are to go to an empty node they will return null

3 ways to access the text of a node,
.firstChild to access the text node of the given element.
.nodeValue will return the text
.textContent will do the same as .nodeValue
IE 8 does not support textContent but can use the innerText property
which works in a similar way.

.getAttribute('') looks for and returns the value of a given attribute
for an element. Returns null if the attribute is not there.

.setAttribute('attribute','newValue')

.classList can e used to access of the the classes an element has

it has methods to add('') and remove('') a class, and has toggle('')
that adds the class if it doesn't have it and removes it if it does

.classList is available on IE 10 and up. You will have
to make the methods yourself if you wanna use them on older browsers.

.createElement('') method is used create an element node

.createTextNode('') does what it says

in order to add the the text node to the element node you use .appendChild('')
to put them together.

you can also use the .textContent property to do the same thing.

You can create a function to do all this to avoid repetitive lines of code

parentNode.insertBefore('newNode', 'nodeAfter') this will put a child node
before the nodeAfter

.removeChild('') used to do what it states

.replaceChild('newNode', 'oldNode')

.getElementsByClassName()
.getElementsByTagName() return live node list, which mean it updates
whenever a change is made onto the page.

.style can be used to modify the css of a given element.

Note that css properties that are seperated by dashes are changed
into camel case.

style.display can be used to make elements dissapear and reappear by
using the values 'none' and 'block' respectively.
