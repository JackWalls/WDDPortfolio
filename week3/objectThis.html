        <pre>'this' is used in object methods to reference the object use to call the method
ie. object thing with method display()
could be referenced within the method as this.variable
this only works inside methods, not object definitions
  this do not look at object definition. Only the moment of call matters.

Note from excersise. Js treats number inputs as strings normally, when added
they concat, multiplication casts them to numbers or returns NaN when
they are not numbers.

Important note, if you want a function to allow chain function calls,
ie object.method().method().method();
then in the method you have return this;
This will return the object each time allowing for chaining to occur
