    <h1>Chapter 5: Objects</h1>
    <pre>
        Object literals
objects contents is defined inside {} with variables defined
as: name: value, no semicolons in besides those in functions,
declarations seperated by commas.

all properties inside objects are mutable, even when the object is
declared as a constant.

Can also use the constructor method but that is not recommended

Shorthand method can be used in ES6 by putting assigned variables
insed of another with {}.

Access properties using dot notation as so Object.property
if accessing method don't forget the ()

Bracket notation can also be used, advantage that it has is that
it evaluate expressions and then use that as the reference to the
property.

Properties can be evaluated inside declaration, this can allow
for the use of + to concatenate or the ternary operator for example.

The in operator can check if a property is found in an object.

'name' in object

or check if does not return undefined

object.name !== undefined

or use the hasOwnProperty('name')

You can use the for in loop to go through the properties
in an object

hasOwnProperty() can be used as a check to make sure the loop
only goes through that objects own properties.

Object.keys('object') returns an array of all the keys
Object.values('object') same but returns an array of values
Object.entries('object') same but returns key value pairs

Add properties by assigning them

object.newProperty = value;

changing a property can be done with the assignment operator

The delete operator can be used to remove a property
ie. delete object.property;

objects can be nested inside of objects, to go down the
heirarchy you use multiple dots

You can use an object as a parameter, this gives the
advantage of not needing to worry about the order.

You can use objects to contain methods and properties to avoid naming
conlficts. This is called a namespace.

JSON.parse(object) can be used to return a js object.

JSON.stringify(object) does the opposite and turns the object
into a JSON string. Note that it does not add methods to the JSON.

Math object is a namespace used to get commonly used math constants
and methods.
