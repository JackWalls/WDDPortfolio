  System error ― there’s a problem with the system or external
    devices with which the program is interacting.

  Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or
    faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a typo.

  User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which
    the program is unable to handle.

Putting 'use strict'; will enable strict mode in order to make
js crack down harder on what would be referred to as 'poor' programming
practices.

Linting sounds like a great tool to enforce style, can they be customized
however in order to support different style choices?

Feature detection to provide error detection in order to handle when
a user's browser does not support a feature.

Common way to implement breakpoints is to use the dialog box alert().

console.trace() can be used for stack tracing.

using the debugger; keyword can set breakpoints that then use the browsers
debugger tool. This will then show the variables set before advancing
the program. Note remove debugger when done testing.

When using throw, it is best to use the error object.

Try and catch are similar to and if else, the condition is that
if an error is thrown the catch code will execute.

finally is used for a try and catch to execute code after the try catch
block.

Maybe I should learn to use jest.
