Task: Explore CSS!! Do the code for Section 3!

localStorage -> Map Data type (Key-Value) that is stored in the browser
Also from: https://javascript.info/localstorage

    Unlike cookies, web storage objects are not sent to server with each request. Because of that, we can store much more. Most browsers allow at least 2 megabytes of data (or more) and have settings to configure that.
    Also unlike cookies, the server can’t manipulate storage objects via HTTP headers. Everything’s done in JavaScript.
    The storage is bound to the origin (domain/protocol/port triplet). That is, different protocols or subdomains infer different storage objects, they can’t access data from each other.

Is it good practice to use localStorage? Do other web developers use it often?

if's within if's = embedded if's

CSS border-radius, good attribute to remember
