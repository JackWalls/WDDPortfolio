Design for the smallest, least powerful device first.

It will allow you to focus on the content, functionality and core
of the design and can lead to clear, simple, and concise apps.

Mobile devices are almost universal, more so than PC's
More people are using mobile for their internet usage

People dont have their heads down on laptops

Start small and scale up

Mobile is not a fad


Be there, help them get to where they want to go as quickly and
efficiently as possible. Mobile users have less patience for mobile
then they do desktop.

Be useful, if the app is not useful to them then they will leave

Be Quick, as the first, people have less patience for mobile.

Reachability, or accesibility. design the execution to make
it easier for the user.

Speed Matters -reduce image usage, SVG/Webfonts are lower badwith
optimize and minify CSS and JS, GZIP files to eliminate unnecessary data

Networks matter


Be more empathetic to our users needs

Primary Controls - reachability, place the important buttons and menus in
the more reachable areas. This creates a perception of speed.
This leads to improved engagement rates and user satisfaction.

Careful using icons. Words with borders look like a button and are more
intuitive in their purpose and function.

Make it simple so people can use it easily

Ditch labels and use the placeholder attribute to hold the labels.

Make input easier to use (reachability and accessibility)

Note to self look how to make the placeholder float on the
text input for better visibility.

It is better to paginate long forms that require a lot of input.

Include a progress indicator for better visibility.

Enabling autocomplete on forms makes it easier for mobile users.

Allow the user to show the characters of the password field or to hide them

I've seen enough credit card forms to know what enables a good experience
and what looks like blatant laziness from the web developer.

Be aware of the keyboard the user will use for the input that is needed.
ex. Number input should only bring up a numpad.

Don't force a copy and paste ex. make phone numbers that can be selected
to make a call.


Before you advertise, do your research.

Pop up and in between ads are a cancer to the user experience.

Ads inside content need to be small and simple.

Window ad, may be useful to keep in mind.

Stop using pop-ups/pop-overs

Some successful sites still use pop-ups/overs, is there an appropriate time and place for
this kind of advertisement?

Keep it simple and sleek.
