Websockets are initialized with constructor with a url to a
websocket.

When the websocket objects connects to the web socket, it fires
an open event that can be picked up by an event listener.

the send(value) method is used to send data to the websocket.

When the connection object waits for a response from the
web socket. This creates the event 'message' that can be
picked up by the event listener.

other events: close for when connection is closed and error
when an error has occurred.

Notification API uses the os notification popup. it will be
displayed to the user even if the page is not the focus.

This results in a promise where notification's permission
property is set to granted or denied. If granted then you can create
a Notification object.
