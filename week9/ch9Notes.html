    </div>
    <div id="content">
        <pre>windows is a global object,

has methods for 3 dialogs

navigator property that is an object contains info of the browser
and os being used, found in the userAgent property.
This is not reliable.

the location property has properties that tells you about the
current url

history property has access to previously visited pages.

window.open() can be used to make a popup
close() is implied

moveTo() moves the window to X and Y coordinates.

resizeTo() changes the height and width of the window

window.screen has access to height and width which tells you the
height and width of the users screen

avail prefix can give that data without os menus

The screen object is more useful for mobiles, main one being a
change in its orientation.

to create a cookie you assign a value to the document cookie
property, as a key value pair as 'key=value', assigning values
to it does not overwrite values, only appends to it. To change
the value you use the key and assign it the new value by
assigning it back to cookie as 'key=newValue'.

To read the contents of the cookie you call the property.
You can use the split method to break the string.

cookies expire after the browser is closed by default, to set
an expriration date by assigning a value to cookie as
'; expires=date' where date is a string in the UTC format

can set the path so the cookie can be read by other pages in the
directory, for it to be read by any page in the root
directory you set '; path=/'

from text:
 Adding the string ; secure to the end of a cookie will
 ensure itâ€™s only transmitted over a secure HTTPS network.

To delete a cookie you set it to expire in the past.
